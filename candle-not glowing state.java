Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
1 6 10 11 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
Here X = 2.
At t = 0, the candle is glowing.
At t = 1, the candle is NOT glowing because a drop of water drops on the candle.
At t = 2, the candle is NOT glowing.
At t = 3, the candle is glowing (2 seconds over).
At t = 4, the candle is glowing.
At t = 5, the candle is glowing.
At t = 6, the candle is NOT glowing as a drop of water drops on the candle.
At t = 7, the candle is NOT glowing.
At t = 8, the candle is glowing (2 seconds over).
At t = 9, the candle is glowing.
At t = 10, the candle is NOT glowing because a drop of water drops on the candle.
At t = 11, the candle is NOT glowing because a drop of water drops on the candle.
At t = 12, the candle is NOT glowing.
At t = 13, the candle is glowing (2 seconds over).
At t = 14, the candle is glowing and so on.
The total time that the candle is not in glowing state is 7.
So 7 is printed as the output.
